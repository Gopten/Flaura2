# Flaura2
An ESP-home based version of Flaura 
Uses mqtt to increase battey savings by sending device to sleep as quickly as possible when watering finishes and just after it receives the moisture readings if the pot is wet enough.
Allow as much as possible to be adjustable from HA so you don't have to keep flashing the ESP.
